                <game-title style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px black, -2px -2px 4px black, 2px -2px 4px black, -2px 2px 4px black;">Geimon!</game-title> (Pronounced: Game On!) is an Online-Only, Two-Player Competitive Card Game.
                <br><br>
                From a worldspace teeming with life, cowboys, wizards, scientists, and knights all meet and clash within Geimon! Science is on the rise, but kings and castles, cowboys and outlaws, all still roam the wilds; and deep below, hidden in the histories lies a dark, ancient magic threatening to make a return.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;When creating Geimon!, we had three key goals:
                <br>
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;1) To make a card game where every time you queue up, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you never know what’s going to happen.</span> We would do everything in our power to prevent samey deck lists and optimized combos.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;2) To make a game <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that’s actually a game</span>. To prevent endless negations, frustrating automatic destruction, infinite recovery, and convoluted text. To make each card <span style="text-decoration: underline;">balanced against every other</span>, to make it so that &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;nearly every game goes right down to the line, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every draw matters</span>.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;3) To give each card and related cards distinct personalities so that when you play them, you would say: <span style="font-style: italic;">“Oh yeah, that’s totally something he would do.”</span>

                <br><br>
                &emsp;We wanted to make a game where even a deck of random cards has a fighting chance.

                How You Win:
                <br>
                • Reduce your Opponent’s life to 0. (Starting Life is 20)
                <br>
                • Your Opponent would draw a card(s), but their Deck is empty.

        <div id="howToPlay" class="tab" style="display: block;">
            <div class="container" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.5); border: 4px solid white; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 10px;">

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each Player designs their own Deck to play, or chooses a Starter option.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Decks must be between 60 and 100 cards. There is nothing else to worry about, no side cards or extra zones. And even simpler, every single card is limited to 1 copy in a Deck, so every single card you see will be unique.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the start of every game, a Player picks up the top 5 cards of their Deck.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;This is your Starting Hand. If you don't like your Starting Hand, then you can optionally redraw once by placing your Starting Hand on the bottom of your Deck and picking up the next 5 cards. You must keep this new Hand.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After redraws have been decided, a Totem is chosen.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;For the first game of a match, or the only game in a best of 1, a random Totem is rolled. Totems are a modification to the game's mechanics. The loser of the previous game in a match chooses the Totem for the next game from a shortlist of 3 randomly selected options, different to the one seen in previous games.</span>

        <div id="whatsInATurn" class="tab">
            <div class="container" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.5); border: 4px solid white; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 10px;">
                <text-body style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">On a Player's turn, there are 6 ‘Phases’: Intermission, Draw, Main 1, Battle, Main 2, and End.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;On the first Player's turn, Battle and Main 2 are skipped.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Intermission Phase</span> is used to handle maintenance costs, as well as pre-draw interactions.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">During the Draw Phase,</span> even on the first turn, the Player whose turn it is draws 1 card.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Main Phase 1,</span> the turn Player can activate Action, Equipment, and Obelisk cards, Rally Champions, or set Rush and Reflex cards face-down for later.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;They can also place Champions and Obelisks into their Reserve from their Hand, or attach Equipments from their Hands to such cards in their Reserve. Doing so has no effect on the game other than revealing the cards, clearing their hand, or readying for later plays. As explained in the section on the Reserve, it acts mostly as a bench, where Players can construct plays in view, but unable to be stopped directly, just planned against by their Opponents.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the Battle Phase,</span> you declare one at a time which of your Champions are attacking this Phase. Champions can attack the turn they are Rallied, unless something stops them.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When you declare an attack, your Opponent can declare a Blocker, i.e. which Champion they are placing in front of your attack. Champions blocking take the attacking Champion's Damage. If they are reduced to 0 Life, they are Destroyed, and go to the Tomb. Blocking Champions deal their Damage to their attackers. Each Champion can only block once per Battle Phase.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The order of a battle goes as follows: Attack Declaration, Blocker Declaration, Flip Resolution, Damage Calculation. <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To break it down better:</span> <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;1) An attack is declared by Player 1. If they have Priority on the Champion, they must declare an attack Target, or simply that they are attacking directly. <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1b) Their Opponent, Player 2, could, if they have one, respond with a Rush card or a Reflex card or effect to that declaration. <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;2) If Player 1 was attacking directly, Player 2 can declare a blocker, or they could not. <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2b) If no card is used in response to the attack declaration, and no blocker is declared, then the attack goes through direct and skips to Damage Calculation, where that Champion's Damage is deducted from the Opponent's Life. <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;3) If a face-down blocker was declared, then before conducting Damage Calculation that Champion is flipped face-up and any Flip effects are activated. Then, a Path begins, and resolves depending on if there are any additional Steps either Player wishes to take. <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;4) Then, Damage Calculation is performed between the two battling Champions. </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Damage Thresholds may have to be met in order to Damage certain Champions, but they do not reduce the Damage taken if they are met or exceeded. Each attack is separate and Champions cannot team up to overcome a Damage Threshold.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Leftover Battle Damage over a Champion's Life is dealt to your Opponent. Unless stated otherwise, Champions can only attack once each during a Battle Phase. Only Battle Damage overextends to hit the Player controlling that card, targeted or effect damage to a Champion does not roll over to hit a Player. It stops when the Damage runs out, or the Champion is Destroyed. If a Champion would be Destroyed by battle, and the destruction is negated, the Champion is instead reduced to 1 Life.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Main Phase 2,</span> a Player can do all the same things they did in Main 1.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And in the End Phase,</span> certain effects will resolve, and like in the Intermission, Players can make skillful plays before the start of the next turn.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;At the end of your End Phase, if you have 7 or more cards in your Hand, you must discard cards so that you have 6 cards in your Hand.</span>

                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Types of Cards:</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unless stated otherwise, only the turn Player can activate cards, and only during their main Phases.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Each Player can only use each effect of a card once per turn; if a Champion is Rallied, you use its effect, and then it is Destroyed, but you Resurrect it, you cannot use its effect again (that turn). Every effect is a hard once-per-turn. Every effect is also Optional unless it is expressly stated to be Mandatory. Mandatory effects are the only effects in the game that can be used more than once per turn, as they must ALWAYS trigger when given the opportunity to.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Champion:</span> Cards that are placed onto the Zone in the Champion Area and symbolize creatures. They are the primary actors in battle.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <p style="margin: 4px 0px 0;">You can only Rally 1 Champion with a Rally Cost of Basic per turn, this is referred to as a Basic Rally. Basic Champions can be Rallied face-up or face-down in the Champion Area. Basic Champions with conditions cannot be rallied facedown, a condition will be clearly stated above the cost line.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="margin: 4px 0px 0;">Starting the turn after you set a Champion face-down, you can flip them face-up during one of your Main Phases. A Champion flipped face-down by a card effect cannot be Flip Rallied on the same turn. Champions are also flipped face-up before Damage Calculation (if they are attacked, or used as a blocker). You can rally as many Elite Champions (Champions with costs other than Basic) as possible per turn, as many as you can pay for, should you desire. These Elite Champions can only be rallied face-up.</p>

                            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 0;">Here is an Example Champion card.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 4px 0px 0;">You will notice that on a Champion card it has a few important things to take note of (From top to bottom): <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Tags:</span> These are 'Cryptbound' and 'Undead' on this card, and these are used to anchor a card into an archetype and are referenced on support cards. For instance, even on this card, it says Retrieve 1 Other Undead when it enters the Tomb. That effect searches for all Champions with the Tag: Undead, and allows you to interact with them. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) Passives:</span> These are effects like 'Deathward', and they apply unique effects to the cards they're on. Most of the time, these effects do not activate, they simple apply to the card or around the card. You can hover your mouse over a card's passives to read what they do. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Effects:</span> These effects trigger at specific times and are listed on a card after its passives. This card only has 1 effect, and that is when it is sent to the Tomb, from anywhere, you can optionally activate the effect to search through your Tomb and retrieve any 1 Undead other than this card. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4) Damage / Life / Damage Threshold:</span> In order on the bottom of a Champion are its Damage (in red), Life (in blue), and Damage Threshold (in lighter blue). These are explained in more depth in the 'What's In A Turn?' section above in the 'Battle Phase' section.</p>

                            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin: 0;">Another Example Champion card, wow this one has a lot of text.</p>
                            <p style="margin: 4px 0 0;">Importantly, there are a few new things not seen on the Skeleton Guard before: <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Condition:</span> A card's condition must always be met before it can be rallied, very few cards bypass a card's condition. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) Cost:</span> A card's cost must be paid before it can be normally activated, there are quite a few effects in the game that bypass a card's cost. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Declarable Effects:</span> Some effects on a card are declarable effects, to use a declarable effect, you first meet its condition (the part before a colon ':', not counting the name of the effect, the colon after that), then you pay its cost (the part of the text before a semicolon ';'), then your Opponent is given a chance to respond, and then finally when you wind back to this card's effect on the Path (described elsewhere in the rules) you resolve the declared effect. <br><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4) Exhaustion:</span> Exhaustion effects can only be used if the card has not already attacked or used an Exhaustion effect. Exhaustion effects mean that for the rest of the turn that card can no longer use other Exhaustion effects or declare attacks.</p>

                                <p style="margin: 4px 0 0;">These cards can also have conditions, costs, and then you resolve their effect before they go to the Tomb.</p>

                    <span style="font-style: italic;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equipment:</span> Cards that must be kept on the Zone within the Arsenal Area and are attached to a face-up Champion. If the Champion leaves the Champion Area, even if they are flipped face-down, their Equipment goes to the Tomb.</span>

                                <p style="margin: 4px 0 0;">After paying the cost, this card remains on the Zone until removed. Its effect is passive and must be addressed in all instances of a Champion attempting to attack (for this example).</p>

                                <p style="margin: 4px 0 0;">As hovering over Mount describes, the subsequent 'Mounted' effects cannot be used unless this card has a Commander. But, when it does have one, then once per turn you can use each of a Commander Obelisk's effects. <br><br> Commander Obelisks are special, when they have a Commander (are mounted), and that Commander leaves the Zone and goes specifically to the Tomb or Void, then the Commander Obelisk is Destroyed and is sent to the Tomb. Other removal, such as the Commander going to the Hand, Reserve, or being set face-down, does not Destroy the Mounted Commander Obelisk, instead it simply frees it up to be mounted again.</p>

                    <span style="font-style: italic;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rush:</span> Cards that can be played at Reflex speed in response to others by the turn Player from within their Hand. These cards go into the Arsenal Area before going to the Tomb. The turn Player can place these cards face-down in the Arsenal Area to activate them in response to an Opponent's actions on their turn. Once a card is placed face-down, it cannot be used until the Intermission Phase of the next turn.</span>

                    <span style="font-style: italic;">• <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reflex:</span> Cards that must be placed face-down before they can be activated. They are mainly used to respond to an Opponent's actions, as they can be stepped after them on the Path. Once a card is placed face-down, it cannot be used until the Intermission Phase of the next turn.</span>

                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: larger;">Before a card or effect resolves (is played), it goes on The Path.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When a card or effect is activated, it Steps onto the Path, either taking the first Step (Path Step 1), or following another in the ongoing Path (Path Step 2 or greater). Rush and Reflex effects are the only effects that can respond to an ongoing Path. If two effects reach triggers at the same time, such as when you Mill 2 and the two cards have "If Sent to Tomb" effects, then you can decide the order of those effects on the Path. Your Opponent can respond after every action you take. Rallies (face-up or face-down) and setting cards face-down in your Arsenal do not start Paths inherently, but they can still be responded to by effects that take the first Step onto the Path. Only card activations and effect activations start Paths.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When a Path begins to resolve (reaches the end with no further steps to take), it resolves backwards, taking the last Step first (resolving the last effect placed onto the Path first), in a first-in/last-out style. Cards and effects cannot respond to things on the Path whilst it is mid-resolution. They must be Stepped one after another whilst building the Path, and then left to play out as they will. As such, cards can theoretically be activated in an order to play around specific responses.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Example 1: A Champion declares an attack (Not starting a Path). Then, as Path Step 1, the Opposing Player activates one of their face-down cards, a Rush card, to respond to their declaration of an attack. Then, as Path Step 2, the attacking Player responds with a Reflex of their own to negate the defending Player's Rush, for this example look up to "Parry!". The Path resolves backwards, the negation triggers at Step 2, then when reaching Step 1, the card has been negated, has no effect, and the attack goes through.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Example 2: A Champion is rallied (Not starting a Path), but it declares its On Rally effect to Add 1 Equipment card (as Path Step 1). Then, the opposing Player responds with a Reflex effect of their Champion (as Path Step 2) to Discard 1 for cost and Destroy 1 card on the Zone for effect. The Path resolves backwards, with the Destroyed card being the freshly Rallied Champion, but because the effect was not negated, when the Path reaches Step 1, the Player who rallied still gets to search their Deck for 1 Equipment and add it to their Hand.</span>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Zone:</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="https://geimon-app-833627ba44e0.herokuapp.com/Public/Images/Site Assets/BoardLabeled.png" style="
                        width: 750px;
                        border: 0.5px solid white;
                    ">
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The board is referred to as the Zone, and is split into various areas: Champion, Arsenal, Reserve, Tomb, and Void.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When cards and effects refer to interacting with cards "On the Zone", the exact definition is: Cards within the Champion Area and The Arsenal. Cards in the Reserve, Tomb, Void, and each others' Decks and Hands are not considered "On the Zone".</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When counting a Player's cards currently controlled, look only to the total sum of cards in their Champions Area and their Arsenal (face-up and face-down).</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Champion Area is where Champions go after they are Rallied. The Arsenal Area is where nearly all other cards go after they are activated.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Reserve is where cards can come into play without entering the Zone.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Champions and Obelisks in the Reserve can be activated as if they were in the Players Hand. So, during an appropriate time, which is usually just during that Player's Main Phase, they can (if the card's conditions are met) pay their costs and play them from the Reserve onto the field like normal. The only exception is that Basic Champions cannot be Rallied from the Reserve face-down, unless an effect declares otherwise.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Cards that go into the Reserve are not counted as played, and in most instances cannot be negated. But, for example, when a Champion leaves the Reserve to enter the Zone, then it is Rallied, and it can be negated.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;When a card is played from the Reserve, it and any attached or linked cards are also played, such as a Champion or Obelisk with an Equipment, or a Champion mounted onto a Commander Obelisk. At such time, the costs for all cards must be paid at once, and you cannot activate any of the cards linked together if you cannot pay all of their costs at the same time.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Tomb is where cards go when they are used, or Destroyed.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Void is where cards go when they are Obliterated.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;Most of the time cards in the Void cannot be interacted with or Reclaimed.</span>
